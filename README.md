# Libraries.js
These are some javascript libraries I use


# complex.js

Used in blog.chemicaldevelopment.us/math/, and my blender program, this code deals with complex (a+bi) numbers.
The general form to represent x+iy is an array, `[x, y]`. When you call a method, like add(A, B), A and B need to be in this form.
A few methods do not require both arrays, such as `scale(A, b)`. A is a complex number and b is a float, this returns A*b.
